# Exploring Coronavirus School Closures Through Data
Udacity Data Scientist Project 1

### Installations:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib.pyplot
4. Seaborn
5. Sklearn

The program was created using Python 3.

### Project Motivation:
This is a project submitted as part of the data science nanodegree on Udacity. The aims of this project were to test a number of hypotheses related to school closures due to COVID-19. The question often arises whether or not this is an affective strategy, I wish to explore this by asking the following questions:

1. Do open schools exacerbate coronavirus outbreaks?
2. Is there a difference between age groups?
3. Can the status of a countryâ€™s school system be used in predicting the severity of a COVID-19 outbreak?

### File Descriptions:
1. A jupyter notebook which includes the CRISP-DM stages followed in analyzing the project questions and hypothesis.
2. A dataset downloaded from Kaggle in csv. format that includes information regarding school closures due to COVID-19 (country, date, school status)
3. a COVID-19 dataset including daily confirmed cases from Our World in Data (directly linked from the website). The dataset includes general information such as new daily cases, median age, new deaths, by country, date, etc.

### Results

The results can be found in the blog post written as part of the project at this link:
