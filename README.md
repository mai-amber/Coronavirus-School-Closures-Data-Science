# Coronavirus-School-Closures-Data-Science
Udacity Data Scientist Project 1

### This project set out to answer the following questions:

1. Do open schools exacerbate coronavirus outbreaks?
2. Is there a difference between age groups?
3. Can the status of a countryâ€™s school system be used in predicting the severity of a COVID-19 outbreak?

### Two datasets were merged:
1. a dataset of school closure information from Kaggle
2. a COVID-19 dataset including daily confirmed cases from Our World in Data

### The project consists of the following:
1. A jupyter notebook of the code written
2. A blog post on Medium, at the following link:
